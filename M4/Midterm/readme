This program shows:
- Hash text with **SHA-256**
- Encrypt and decrypt text using **AES-GCM**
- Check that the decrypted text matches the original by comparing hashes

1. You type in some text.
2. The program makes a SHA-256 hash of it.
3. It encrypts the text using AES-GCM (random key + random IV).
4. It decrypts the text back to normal.
5. It hashes the decrypted text again.
6. If both hashes match, it prints “Hashed verified.”
